## Info about using VS Code Dev Container
1. Download Docker desktop and VS Code if you don't have them already-
2. In VS Code, download the extension Dev Containers.
3. Now VS Code should recognize this folder through the downloaded extension. You might get a message in the lower right hand part of the window asking about "reopening in container", which you should answer "yes" to. If it doesn't show up, click on the green part in the lefthand bottom corner of VS Code and select "reopen in container" from the command list that pops up. If problem arises there should be helpful information from VS Code on devcontainers.
